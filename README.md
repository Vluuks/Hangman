# Hangman

This app is titled Hangman for now as I do not know a better name atm.

# Summary

This hangman game is a different take on the classic version that adds some extra fun by having the letters you pick impact the game in another way, aside from showing them in the word when guessed correctly, they will also be crossed off a grid, which could have consequences for your score...

# Features
* Recognises which letters are in the word and which arent
* Immediate response to user's keyboard presses


# TODO
* Import dictionary
* Recognise win/lose scenarios
* Track highscores
* Implement good/evil class
* Remember  progress
