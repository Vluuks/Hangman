# Hangman

# Summary
This app is titled Hangman and contains both an evil and good version of the game.
 
# Features
* Recognises which letters are in the word and which aren't.
* Highscore table to keep track of user's performance.
* Immediate response to user's keyboard presses.
* Evil and good mode.
* Options to set your preferred word length and failed guesses allowed.


# Notes
I would have liked to incorporate the keyboard key press detection and subsequent behaviour in the Good/Evil classes but the nature of the OnKeyUp method made this impossible. This is why it's placed in MainActivity.
