# Hangman

This app is titled Hangman for now as I do not know a better name atm.

# Summary

This hangman game is a different take on the classic version that adds some extra fun by having the letters you pick impact the game in another way, aside from showing them in the word when guessed correctly, they will also be crossed off a grid, which could have consequences for your score...

# Features
* Letters in a grid structure that add or remove points if two adjacent letters are either guessed correctly or incorrectly.
* A timer to add more pressure to those who like that kind of stuff.
* Option to choose between short words and long words.
* Sound effects to enhance the game experience.
